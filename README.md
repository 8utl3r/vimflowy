Vimflowy: Vim shortcuts for Workflowy

Mode indicator
--------------

In the bottom left corner there is a mode indicator that shows what mode you are in currently. 

Usage tips
----------

If you're using [cvim](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cvim/ihlenndgcmojhcghmfjfneahoeklbjjh) (or any other Chrome extensions that install modal keybindings), make sure you add `http*://*.workflowy.com/*`to the excluded URLs.

It also works if you run Workflowy in Chromium's app mode: i.e. `chromium --app="https://workflowy.com"` (the extension is loaded underneath).

Installation
------------

* for chrome
  1. Clone this repo (or your fork) somewhere on your filesystem. 
  2. go to `chrome://extensions/`
  3. click 'Load unpacked extension...' button right below 'Extensions' header in the top left corner of the page
  4. point at the vimflowy repo directory
  5. ...
  6. profit

Tested on
---------

Only tested on window 10 so far. Some keybindings might differ on MAC - so let me know if something isn't working!
